### About this Repository

This repository belongs to Marco Valero. It contains my weekly [blogs](https://hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019.github.io/ValeroM-weekly/) written by me about my assignments, what I've personally done for each assignment, and the progression I've made in contributing to Open Source Projects for my course in Open Source Software Development.
