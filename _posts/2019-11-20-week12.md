#### Weekly Readings & Project Progress  

The article named ["Election fraud: Is there an open source solution?"](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/voting-fraud-open-source-solution?) is very interesting. To be honest, I was very surprised with how outdated the voting system is. I can also imagine how some proprietary software can be modifed in a negatively/unfair way.  Before reading the article, using an open source voting system did not cross my mind. I think that using a voting system that is completely open source would be very fair, safe and trustworthy. I think that during these times specially, being able to make a vote and know that it is going to be safe, is very important for the future and for everyones peace of mind.  

##### [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp)  

After my first contribution last week, I've been even more motivated to contribute back to [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp). The contrubution I did felt very fullfiling and I can't wait to hopefully contribute more.  
Today I opened up a [PR](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/37772) for a description that, personally, did not feel very clear and/or intutive. I hope to hear back from a maintainer soon.  
Update: My [PR](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/37772) was merged!
