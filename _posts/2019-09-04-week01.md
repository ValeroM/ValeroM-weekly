#Blog Week 1 (ending 09/04):  
I decided to take this class (Open Source Software Development) because I love the idea of many intelligent, smart and passionate people from all over the world coming together to work on something and make it even better. I think that the Open Source Software Development community is very cooperative and helpful.

Another reason why I chose to take this class is because a couple of friends took this class last semester and they heavily recommended it to me. Most of them emphasized the great hands-on experience, the lectures and the professor.
