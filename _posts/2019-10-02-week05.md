#### In-class summary:

This week in class we went over a collaboration workflow presentation and a git activity using this workflow. In addition, we had a quiz on git.  
I'm personaly finding all the stuff about git and Github very useful. As mentioned in one of my previous blogs, while I'm already familiar with the very basic git workflow, the activities, quizzes, and slides are solidifying my knowledge even more but at the same time, they are raising questions for me to ask or do research on in regards to new terms or new commands.  
I'm also really enjoying going into depth about how to contribute to Open Source projects. This class is preparing me and my classmates very well for the future regarding Open Source Software Devlopment.

#### Assignment:

**_Read Section 4 of [GitHub's How To Contribute](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to)._**

Out of all the resources listed in the link above, I personally found useful the ones that have a very detailed search engine. More specifically, I personally really liked these:

- [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
- [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)
- [First Contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io/)

These resources really narrowed down what type of project I'm looking for by listing or having search bars for languages, labels, tags etc. Moreover, the design felt very organized for me, the user.
