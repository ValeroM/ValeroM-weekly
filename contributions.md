| 3      | https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/74456792 | OpenStreetMap feature | I updated two features in this edit. The first one was a location update. The pharmacy I updated moved to a new street. For the second feature, I updated it from a church to a clinic since the church is no longer there. |
| 3      | https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/74414315 | OpenStreetMap feature | Updated a location of a church. It was poiting to the wrong building in the correct street.                                                                                                                                 |
